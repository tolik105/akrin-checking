3. **Does AKRIN offer 24×7 monitoring and support?**
   Absolutely. We operate a round-the-clock service desk and network-operations centre that monitors your infrastructure, responds to alerts, and resolves tickets in real time—even on Japanese public holidays.

4. **How does AKRIN keep my data secure and compliant?**
   Our security stack includes endpoint protection, zero-trust access, and SIEM monitoring aligned with ISO 27001 best practices. We help you meet Japan's APPI, GDPR, and industry-specific standards through continuous patching, vulnerability management, and audit-ready documentation.
