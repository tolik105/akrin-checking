**FAQ Items:**

1. **Q:** What IT services does AKRIN provide in Japan?
   **A:** AKRIN delivers end-to-end technology solutions—managed IT services, 24/7 help-desk support, cybersecurity & compliance, cloud migration, onsite support, wireless surveys, and custom development—so you can run and scale your business without juggling multiple vendors.

2. **Q:** Can AKRIN deploy onsite engineers quickly?
   **A:** Yes. Our Tokyo-based field team can be on-site anywhere in Japan—often same-day in the Kanto region and within 24 hours nationwide—for critical incidents, project roll-outs, or scheduled maintenance.

3. **Q:** Does AKRIN offer 24×7 monitoring and support?
   **A:** Absolutely. We operate a round-the-clock service desk and network-operations centre that monitors your infrastructure, responds to alerts, and resolves tickets in real time—even on Japanese public holidays.

4. **Q:** How does AKRIN keep my data secure and compliant?
   **A:** Our security stack includes endpoint protection, zero-trust access, and SIEM monitoring aligned with ISO 27001 best practices. We help you meet Japan's APPI, GDPR, and industry-specific standards through continuous patching, vulnerability management, and audit-ready documentation.

5. **Q:** Can AKRIN support bilingual (English & Japanese) environments?
   **A:** Yes. All consultants and help-desk staff are bilingual. We provide tickets, reports, and meetings in either language—ideal for multinational teams operating in Japan.

6. **Q:** What is the typical timeline for a cloud-migration project?
   **A:** A standard mid-size migration (50–150 workloads) takes 4–8 weeks: assessment (1 wk), planning (1 wk), pilot (1 wk), phased cut-over (1–3 wks), optimisation (1 wk). Critical apps remain online thanks to AKRIN's zero-downtime methodology.

7. **Q:** Do you perform wireless surveys before access-point upgrades?
   **A:** Yes. Our Ekahau-powered wireless surveys map coverage, interference, and capacity so we can recommend the exact AP count and placement—eliminating dead zones and costly re-installs.
